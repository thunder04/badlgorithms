# Badlgorithms

Implementation of various algorithms in Rust, mostly those I were taught in my university's Algorithms class and some others I happened to see.

_Also I chose this name because the implementations may not be the best 😔, or blazing fast ⚡._
<sup>_You gotta admit though, the name sounds good._</sup>
