# Badlgorithms

Implementation of various algorithms in Rust, mostly those I were taught in my university's Algorithms class and some others I happened to see.

_Also I chose this name because the implementations may not be the best ðŸ˜”, or blazing fast âš¡._
<sup>_You gotta admit though, the name sounds good._</sup>

## Running an algorithm

_[Rust, along with Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org) must be installed._

First run `cargo run --example` to see the available examples (algorithms)
and then run `cargo run --example EXAMPLE_NAME` to execute it.
